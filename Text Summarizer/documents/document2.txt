NTK leader Seeman said, “We were given assurances that there would be no violence but we were attacked. Filmmaker Vetrimaaran was attacked without any provocation. Even women were attacked. I went to ask why we were being attacked.”

Further more, Mr. Seeman said, “When we protested before for Cauvery, 20 buses were torched in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu vehicles plying in Karnataka and the drivers were attacked and Tamils were killed in Andhra Pradesh. Are these not violence? When he talks about police violence, he should also talk about violence unleashed by the police, is it not? Why is he not at all talking about that?”
