Actor Rajinikanth’s tweet condemning the violence against police personnel has evoked criticism from various parties.

He had tweeted: “The worst form of violence in law and order situation is attack on uniformed personnel on duty. This form of violence has to be tackled immediately as it poses grave danger to our country. We need more stringent laws to punish the perpetrators of attack on police personnel on duty.”

Responding to it, Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi president Thol. Thirumavalavan said that actor Rajinikanth’s response was shocking. “Does he not know the amount of violence that is being unleashed on innocent people everyday by the police? How can he conceal the violence perpetrated by the police and just talk about the violence perpetrated on police?” Asking for stringent laws to put down protests only shows his dictatorial tendencies, he added.
